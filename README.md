# prime-number
My first repository. Creates a list of all prime numbers in a specific range (default is 0-1000).

It will return:
- Hello World
- A list of prime numbers in a range of 0-1000 (if you want, you can change the range on the first "for" iteration by whatever you want)
- A benchmark of how much process it takes
